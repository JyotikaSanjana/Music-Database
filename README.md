This script  creates a database called music_db with tables for artists, albums, tracks, playlists, and a junction table playlist_tracks to handle the many-to-many relationship between playlists and tracks.
You can then use SQL commands to insert, update, delete, join and query data from these tables as needed for managing your music database.
